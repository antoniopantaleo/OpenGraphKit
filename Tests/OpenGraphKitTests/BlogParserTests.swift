        Adding features without touching existing code; is it even possible?

        <!--more-->

        At first glance, it might seem impractical, if not impossible. Yet, with the right design pattern, this becomes not only feasible but elegantly simple. Today, weâ€™ll explore the `Decorator Pattern`, a structural Design Pattern that allows us to *add functionality to a class without altering its code*.

        ## A Real-World Example
        """
        let result = try await BlogParser.parseBlogData(content)
        XCTAssertEqual(result.title, "Decorator Pattern, a personal favorite")
        XCTAssertEqual(result.quote, "Adding features without touching existing code; is it even possible?")
    }
    
}
